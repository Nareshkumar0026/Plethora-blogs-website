        <h2 class="text-wrap fst-italic fw-normal p-3 text-success">The official Sims 4 account has confirmed with release of Horse Ranch DLC.</h2>
        <article class="lh-base">The official Sims 4 website provides the following description of the themes we can expect from the Horse Ranch expansion:
          "There is no better feeling than coming home to your very own stretch of land inspired by the great American West.
           Players can explore the rustic locale and curate their ideal ranch life – whether that be a barn full of animal friends or a relaxing cabin on the prairie, each moment is sure to feel authentic and meaningful."
           Players will have the opportunity with this expansion to raise, train, and form bonds with various Horses, and also care for adorable Mini Goats and Mini Sheep. You can even saddle up and meander into town!
            
           <p class="text-center"> Price: £34.99 (or equivalent pricing in your country)<br>
            Release Date: July 20th, 2023<br></p>

            Sims will now welcome Horses into their families and care for every aspect of their lives.
             Also, each animal will provide a unique contribution to the ranch. You can expect to do things like mucking a Horse Bed, harvesting Prairie Grass for the Animal Feeder,
              craft Nectar by stomping various fruits (which can then be consumed for various effects), and much more!</article>
        <article>You can now customize your Horses in CAS, or get new Horses by rescuing, breeding, or purchasing them! You can choose from real-world breeds, change the horse's head shape, mane, tail, feathers, body mass, coat length and more.
             Foals can be born on your ranch too, which may be able to unlock a unique Trait!

            <li> Temperament </li>
            <li>  Agility </li>
            <li> Jumping </li>
             <li>Endurance</li>
             
            You can develop the Jumping Skill by practicing on Horse Jumps. They develop the Agility Skill by practicing on Horse Barrels.
             All of these skills apply to the competitions that take place at the Equestrian Center. 
             Winning competitions results in Simoleons, rewards such as plaques for your walls and metal signs you can display on your big Ranch Sign.
