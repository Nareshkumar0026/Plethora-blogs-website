        <article class="lh-base">A Pirate's Life, the integration is finally coming your way! We've worked closely with Lucasfilm Games to bring Monkey Island to Sea of Thieves, resulting in an experience that's expansive, exciting and entertaining.

          Over the course of three brand new Tall Tales, you'll be invited to tour and explore beloved locations beginning with Mêlée Island, 
          and interact with iconic characters including Guybrush Threepwood himself. Throughout The Legend of Monkey Island you'll solve puzzles, 
          tussle with adversaries and tackle unexpected trials as you strive to put right situations that have gone bizarrely wrong and confront
           a looming peril born of powers from both worlds.
          Players can expect to learn more about how these places are connected through an experience underscored by a rich seam of comedy,
           but right now we want to leave as much as possible to be discovered as you go. Whether this is your dream crossover as a long-term fan or
            fated to be your first foray onto the shores of Monkey Island, we hope you'll feel the love that's gone into this collaboration and find plenty to love in return.
          
          The Legend of Monkey Island is coming free to all Sea of Thieves players, beginning with the first of three new Tall Tales on July 20th.
           Bring your wits, your finest hat and a talking skull, and we'll see you mighty pirates there.<br>
