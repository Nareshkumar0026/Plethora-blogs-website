        <article class="lh-base"> The premier trailer for Assassin’s Creed Mirage is only CGI, which is very common for the AC franchise in general.
             Even so, a lot of details can be learned and inferred based on what was shown.
             The first major reveal (unless you’ve been following the leaks) is that Basim from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla will be the protagonist of this title.
             It opens with him appearing to be initiated into the Brotherhood of Assassins in a ritual before cutting to a bright and lively market in the new setting of Baghdad.
             Basim wanders through the market, pickpocketing a merchant, but he is noticed and forced to flee. He parkours his way through the streets, knocking over stands to delay the perusing guards. This is a younger Basim, though, and he is unable to escape. Before he can be captured or killed, an assassin slays the guards and offers him her hand. This is how he joins the Brotherhood and begins his assassin training.
            The trailer shows him sparring with other assassins in a castle still under construction, which they use to practice more parkour movements.
              Cutting back to the ritual, Basim silently uses a red hot knife to remove his left ring finger, as all old assassins did.
            A massive city shot shows off a stunning vista as Basim sends an eagle out to fly from his arm.
             A man, presumably a target, walks through a street while beggars plead for money as we hear the tenants of the Assassin Order.
              One beggar is actually Basim, catching the guards by surprise and dispatching them with little effort.
              When his target realizes what is going on and sends the other guards after him, a red smoke bomb goes off, allowing Basim to dispatch the guards with a sword and dagger.
             Another group runs at him, leading to a chase into an alley where another trap, this time a deadly poison gas, is released. 
             Basim and his eagle track his target, not running to escape, with one guard using explosive bombs to attack. Basim catches up to his target,
              steals his golden mask, and finishes him off with his hidden blade.<br>
