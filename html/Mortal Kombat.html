             However, there will also be an early access period for those who purchase either the Premium or Kollector’s Edition of the game.<br>
             <h2>Platforms</h2>
             This fighter is ditching last-gen consoles and will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and, most surprisingly, Nintendo Switch.</article>

                Mortal Kombat 1’s trailer opens with Liu Kang explaining his decision to create a “blank canvas” where people are free to choose whether to live in peace or in combat.
                 As he continues, we see many of the iconic characters from the past in their original forms, 
                 including Raiden without any godly powers since those were passed to Liu Kang in Mortal Kombat 11.
                  Of course, it wouldn’t be a Mortal Kombat game without showing Scorpion and Subzero about to face off. 
                  However, before any potential fights break out, an eclipse captures everyone’s attention. A portal opens and Shang Tsun appears 
                and a montage of him absolutely brutalizing the cast ensues with the exception of Liu Kang who takes him down with what must be a future Fatality.</article>
